# Bayesian Network Structure Learning for COVID Clinical Variables Modeling
The project is about using permutation test and genetic algorithm to learn a Bayesian Network modeling the COVID clinical variables that are relevant to severity.
This is an ongoing project so the repository might be updated from time to time.
genetic_alg.ipynb reproduces the result of genetic algorithm and output the network edges in a csv file, which can be used for visualizing the network using the tool Cytoscape.
